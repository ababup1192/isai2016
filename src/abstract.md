In recent years, the social coding paradigm has become commonly used in software development, taking advantage of version control systems and tracking functions. However, most social coding platforms do not provide modeling tools which support the creation of documents for corresponding products. In the present paper, we propose modeling tools for social coding. The tools are based on hybrid editors, where different experts on a project team can use the correct input methods to modify some features of software components. These editors allow users to manipulate both a visual construct in a high-level representation and the corresponding texts in the low-level format. Some advantages of these approaches are also discussed through a case study and its evaluation.
