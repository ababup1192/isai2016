# Test for visual modeling tools
In our visual modeling tools, UML diagrams are generated by both a text and GUI manipulations. These manipulations cost of functions is different or unable to functions. In this section, the number of times of the operations are counted about generating of UML diagrams. テストでは、UMLを生成するために、使われる基本的な操作やよく行われる操作を項目として列挙し、操作回数をカウント書き込む。

Text editor can use replacement function and  regular expression matching in our tests. In addition, CUI tools about text manupulations and version control  systems are used. The rules of an one step in text manipulations is as follows:

- To add texts a range.
- To replace texts a range.
- To cut and delete texts a range.
- To search a word.

The rules of an one step in GUI manipulations is as follows:

- To push a button.
- To select a object.
- To drag and drop a object.
- To change an info of a object.

The results of a package diagram is as follows:

| Manipulations | Text | GUI |
|-----|:-------:|:---:|
| To create a package or a class |2|2|
| To change an info class or package |1|1|
| To delete a package or a class |1|1|
| To change package location |2|1|
| To search a package or a class |1|1|
| To search a package or a class which use reglar expression mathching |1| no support |
| To search a package which includes a class |1| no support |
| To go a state which use Git |1| no support |

The results of a class diagram is as follows:

| Manipulations | Text | GUI |
|-----|:-------:|:----:|
| To create a class |2|2|
| To change an info class |1|1|
| To delete a class |1|1|
| To change a relation of classes |1|1|
| To search a class |1|1|
| To search a class which use reglar expression mathching |1| no support |
| To search a class which has a relation with a class |1| no support |
| To go a state which use Git |1| no support |

The differ of text and GUI basic manipulations is little in results of our tests. 複雑な操作になるとGUI操作では多くの機能を組み込まない限り実現は不可能なことがわかった。しかし、基本的な操作では同じステップ数でもGUI操作のほうが直感的でわかりやすいと考えられる。それらの事実を確認するには、今回のテストでは不十分で、さらに別なテストを思案する必要がある。
