# Conclusion
Visual modeling tools based on hybrid editors for social coding and their usability in short-term projects related to agile software development have been presented. The editors allow users, including both non-programmers and programmers, as well as other project members, to have different roles. The editors allow users to manipulate both a visual construct in a high-level representation based on UML and the corresponding texts in the low-level format based on YAML. The modeling tools automatically generate template codes in different languages as products based on the intermediate data, which synchronize the representations in UML and YAML. The preliminary experiment on the tool has demonstrated that hybrid editors can decrease the number of operations needed to create a class diagram and the corresponding product codes compared to other types of editors. Hybrid editors also have advantages over version control systems in managing products. Our results show that the tools can be applied to short-term software development based on social coding. Future research will include the development of a generator, which converts the source codes to the corresponding models, as well as an evaluation based on comparison with other development strategies and modeling tools.
